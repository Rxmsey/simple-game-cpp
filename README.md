# simple-game-cpp
build a simple 2d game with c++

# You need:
1. A C++ compiler (GCC or Clang)
2. SFML library
3. IDE (Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or Xcode)
4. Game assets (images, fonts, etc.)
5. Basic understanding of C++ and SFML


The code is a simplified example and it is missing some important parts to make it a complete game:

The code doesn't handle the game's state, such as the player's score or the current level.
The code doesn't have any collision detection, so the player can move through other objects on the screen.
The code doesn't handle any of the game's sound or music.
The code doesn't handle any menus or other UI elements to navigate the game.
The code doesn't handle loading or saving the game's data.
The code doesn't handle any error conditions, such as missing files.
It is worth noting that this example is meant to illustrate the basic structure of a 2D game using C++ and SFML, and it is not intended as a complete game. It is a starting point to build a more complete game by adding more features, handling errors and game states, and polishing the user experience.
